# Python Coding Problems

## Overview
This repository is my solutions for problems from  
[Daily Coding Problems](https://dailycodingproblems.com), and please go check out
their free newsletter and support them. The subscription for getting daily problems
is free, and although I just use the free version, they also have a paid version
where they will provide solutions as well.


## About the Code
I do these problems mostly for fun and I figure it's probably not bad practice either,
and I am aware that these problems may sometimes have much cleaner or more efficient
solutions, however, due to responsibilities and life, I can't invest the time to
refactor all of them and make sure they all run as efficiently as possible.


## Contributing
However, if you happen to spot one of these because you're looking through this
repository, then first of all let me ask "why?", and then please submit a pull request
and fix it or just point it out to me and I'll fix it. I appreciate it!


## License
Obviously this code is under **MIT** and I don't care what you do with it and no
credit or anything required.
